Kanad is a framework for building microservices quickly. It's named after the ancient Indian sage/maharishi - "Kanad" to recognize and appreciate his work in meta-physics. He was the first to propose theory of atom(s), and documented details of their behaviour and interaction in his book- Vaiśeṣika Sūtra.
